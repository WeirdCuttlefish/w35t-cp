# Introduction
## Installing C++
C++ will be your language of choice for competitive coding due to it being much faster than alternatives. In fact, it can range from 30 to even 400 times faster than Python. On top of this, most competitive programmers use C/C++ meaning you'll be able to understand and use more established code. 

If you're running Linux or macOS you can skip the next steps, otherwise, keep reading. 

Step 1: Install MinGW Installation Manager: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

Step 2: Open the MinGW Installation Manager mark every package for installation + install

Step 3: Check if MinGW is installed using ``g++ -v`` within powershell, if you get an error you need to add MinGW to the PATH, look up how to do this

Step 4: Enter the directory within your terminal of a C++ file and do ``g++ file.cpp`` to get an executable file called a.exe, then do ``./a.exe`` to run the program.

## Choosing a Text Editor (I will add IDEs too once I get started with using them)
**VSCode** - I reccomend this one because it is easy to use and you can hop right into coding. However, because it is an electron application it is a bit slower. The built in terminal is very nice - https://code.visualstudio.com/ - 8/10

**Sublime Text** - I've used this once or twice, and it is VERY fast. However, I wasn't used to it and it comes a bit bare out of box so I went back to VSCode - https://www.sublimetext.com/ - 7/10

**Vim** - This is for true tryhards, if you master VIM you won't need your mouse anymore. Vim can and will speed up your workflow, but only after months of pain - https://www.vim.org/ - 10/10 if sweat

**Atom** - No longer maintained as Microsoft owns both Atom and VSCode, however it's very aesthetic (It's also terribly slow) - https://atom.io/ - 5/10

Now you're set to start your coding adventure!

## Practice
Now that you've set up your coding enviroment, it's time to practice. Here we'll learn how to properly practice as well as where you can find practice. 

Pick a problem OUT of your comfort zone with a writeup and then work on it for 20 minutes. If you have no clue past 20 minutes look at the writeup until you have an idea of what to do and start working on it again. Then do a few problems that use the same skill to master what you've learnt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7169jEvb-Y

**Codeforces:** Amazing practice problems and website - https://codeforces.com/problemset - 9/10

**Leetcode:** Very good writeups, however is meant for interviews, not Competitive Coding - https://leetcode.com/ - 6/10

**Codechef:** Personally haven't tried but have heard good things - https://www.codechef.com/ - NA
# Competitions
## USACO
USACO is a competitive programming competition specifically made for high schoolers. There are four divisions (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum) which you can advance thorugh by doing well in your current division. Becoming one of the 24 finalists gives you a shot at representing America at the International Olympiad in Informatics.

## Codeforces
Codeforces is a Russian Based competitive programming site. Competitions happen about 1-2 times a week, each lasting 2 hours with around 5 questions. The website uses an ELO system to rate your skills. The website also has a very useful practice section that I highly reccomend using.

## Facebook Hacker Cup
I haven't participated in this competition myself, however from my understanding is that there is a qualification round and then multiple rounds following where participants are eliminated.

## Google Kickstart
GKS is Google's "intro to CP" competition. However, this does not mean that the competition is "easy" by any means. An interesting twist on this competition is that if your algorithm is correct, but slow, you may score partial credit as it gives points according to how many test case sets you pass. Another niche is that you must include "Case #n:" before every one of your answers.

## TSA
TSA is the official competition of our club. The competition is much less algorithmic compared to the above competitions but may require more niche knowledge about your language.
